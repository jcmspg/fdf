## MAYBE ADD A FEATURE TO TURN HIDDEN LINES ON / OFF ?? --for the sake of readability

1. refactor the reset_movement so it wont read the file all over again.. make it faster and simpler.

2. need to implement zoom
3. need to implement rotation

3. implement a way to raise or lower the points

5. find out a way to cycle through several color schemes??

6. need to make a decent gui

7. also, adding a splash screen would be fun.

### make a toggle for keyboard commands

. for instance, press P -> WASD to pan around
              press R -> WASD QE to rotate around each axis
              press Z -> WS to zoom in and out
              press T -> WS increase or decrease the heights

. non toggle:
              press Z -> RESET
              press C -> switch color scheme (grayscale, RGB, etc etc)
