TODO

recheck the distance between the points in order to be able to draw the whole grid INSIDE THE WINDOW

also, need to CENTER THE WINDOW

---- ALSO AND IMPORTANT ! ----
it is crashing when i try to run the maps t1 and t2 so far. it has to do with the atois and splits when reading the map. perhaps its because of the color codes>? NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE COLOR CHECK


isometric view is kinda sorted.. just need to resize and center the grid

NEED to address the memory issues with big maps.. no idea why its segfaulting

--- NEXT STEPS ---

MAYBE ADD A FEATURE TO TURN HIDDEN LINES ON / OFF ?? --for the sake of readability

NEED TO IMPLEMENT COLORS

MAYBE REFACTOR EVERYTHING SO I DONT USE THE ALLOC_MAP and i dont get sigsevs anymore..

also need to add key hooks for panning and in the future, zoom in/out.

----> IMPLEMENT A UI  or just an intro screen .... mb with ascii art?? <----
