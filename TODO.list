TODO

recheck the distance between the points in order to be able to draw the whole grid INSIDE THE WINDOW

also, need to CENTER THE WINDOW

---- ALSO AND IMPORTANT ! ----
it is crashing when i try to run the maps t1 and t2 so far. it has to do with the atois and splits when reading the map. perhaps its because of the color codes>? NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE COLOR CHECK


isometric view is kinda sorted.. just need to resize and center the grid


--- NEXT STEPS ---

IMPLEMENT THE Z AXIS !!!!!!!\
there has to be a way to just multiply with the y coordinate and BAAM ! done
