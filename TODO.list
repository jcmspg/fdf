read a .fdf file
iterate the file and figure out how many lines and columns

ex:     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
        [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] 
        [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] 
        [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] 
        [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] 

so it means i need a grid with 5x5 intersections, (it is the vertices/intersec
that have the height value)

first i need to draw the gid. ignore the height values for now.

---HOW TO READ A FDF FILE???
1. feed the file as an arg to the main
2. read the file (GNL)
3. check the nbr of lines
4. use split to check nr of columns
